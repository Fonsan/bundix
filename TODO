* Provide a --lock command that also creates the lockfile

* Submit a PR to bundler to find git and svn sources on $GEM_PATH.
* In bundlerEnv, copy paths to a new "paths" output. Perhaps use subdirectories
  named after the gem itself. Will need to convert the sources derivation to
  program that generates the actual sources.rb.

* Expose git #branch and #tag.
* Given a branch or a tag, resolve the commit hash, and put that
  in the manifest and in the cache.

* Make sure .bundle/config isn't modified.
* Use extconf.rb to make patching paths easier.
* Bundix cache needs to take into account the flags used to fetch the git repo
  (e.g. --leave-dotGit, --fetch-submodules)
